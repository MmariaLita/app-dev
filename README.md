 ### MyFavorite Movie is Squid Game

*Squid Game is a South Korean drama in which a group of desperate and poor people from all backgrounds and ages *
- are invited to participate in a game with a top prize of 45.6 billion Won (around USD 35 million). 
**However, when the games begin the players realize that those who are eliminated are actually killed.**
